# Credit Risk and Fraud Analytics

## Overview
This repository explores how analytics can be applied to support credit risk assessment and fraud detection decisions.

The emphasis is on using data-driven logic to improve decision quality, not just on building models.

All data used is either public, mock, or sanitized.

---

## Business Context
Financial institutions face challenges in:
- Identifying high-risk entities
- Detecting potential fraud early
- Balancing risk control with business growth

Analytics plays a critical role in supporting these decisions.

---

## Analytical Approach
- Exploratory analysis to understand risk patterns
- Feature selection based on business relevance
- Model evaluation with a focus on interpretability
- Translating outputs into insights usable by decision-makers

---

## Tools Used
- Python for analysis and modeling
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model evaluation techniques

---

## Key Takeaways
- Analytics is most effective when aligned with business context
- Model outputs must be explainable to stakeholders
- Risk metrics should support action, not just accuracy scores

---

## Notes
This project demonstrates analytical thinking and decision support patterns rather than production-grade models.
